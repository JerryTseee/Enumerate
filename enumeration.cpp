//this is a pseudo code

// recursive algorithm to enumerate all subsets of T with size = k (k â‰¤ n) and

// as follows (can be in any order):
// -4, 1
// -4, 3
// 1, 3

//x is the input set, k is the size of the combinations to generate, n is the number of elements in set x

            //create a new set by removing the i-th element x[1:i] from x, to ensure same element is not used again
